Project Overview
This Python package provides advanced tools for hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation in machine learning. 
It enables comprehensive exploration of parameter spaces, adapts feature values to ensure consistency, and integrates 
default metrics for both regression and classification tasks.

Features
Search Space Generation: Create detailed hyperparameter search spaces using functions that generate both uniform and random samples.

Feature Value Adaptation: Convert scalar or iterable inputs into one-dimensional NumPy arrays for model compatibility.

Hyperparameter Mapping: Transform mappings of hyperparameters into structured formats, supporting both scalar and iterable values.

Model Metrics: Includes default evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, RÂ² score, and more for regressors and classifiers.

Model Validation: Functions to check model types and ensure appropriate metrics are applied based on whether the model is a regressor or classifier.
